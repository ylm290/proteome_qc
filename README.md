Assessing plasma protein expression levels from patients with systemic autoinflammatory diseases and establishing outlier-based quality control and normalization workflow for the SomaScanÂ® assay

*Abstract*
Clinical characteristics of patients who are diagnosed with systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAID) are very similar. The disease-defining biomarkers have yet to be determined. SomaScan assay v4.1 utilizes libraries of affinity reagents (i.e., Slow Off-Rate Modified Aptamers, or analytes) and enables simultaneous profiling of 7,288 human plasma proteins. An in-depth investigation is
necessary to establish a bespoke data processing workflow in the context of the SAID cohort (N = 144) as the protein content differs in various age and disease groups. 

This study has set out to examine reliability of the technology and the impacts of different processing steps to the proteome data. Firstly, I established a quality control step with outlier detection strategy using the six median absolute deviations (MADs) and determined a threshold using the elbow method from the total number of outliers across the cohort. After the QC, no signs of bias were revealed in clustering analysis using entire analytes. Significant correlations of C-
reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) with the matching tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data, R > 0.6 and R > 0.8 (p < 0.001) respectively, reassure the technology.

Differential expression (DE) analysis demonstrated that log10 transformation reduces skewness in the dynamic range of plasma protein. CRP and SAA were differentially expressed across all datasets that
were processed in various ways, and Albumin was only found in the untransformed data. By using the optimized workflow, the complement system (i.e., C5, C5a, and C9) from the top 10 DE proteins were noticeable since their dysfunction is known for enhancing inflammatory reactions in already injured tissues. These confirmative findings show that the assay is reliable, and the optimized workflow facilitates biomarker discovery. The Somascan assay could accelerate the diagnosis of SAID subtypes, which is pivotal for clinical and scientific progress in the field of autoinflammatory diseases.
